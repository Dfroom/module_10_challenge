# module_10_challenge
Created Read Me and started code.

Progress being made.
Completed vast majority of the coding.
Ran into probelms in the "Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data" section.
I think the primary issue is being too tired to be honest.
Will take another look after some sleep.
